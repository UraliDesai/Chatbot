# Chatbot
In this project, we developed a generative based conversation agent using a word embedding and sequence to sequence modeling with encoder-decoder architecture. Before the above procedure, data preprocessing tasks like tokenization, vocabulary, and zero-padding also can be performed for better responses generated by conversation agents. The encoder-decoder architecture consists of the recurrent neural network with 3-layers of Gated Recurrent Units Networks. During training, we have used RMSprop optimizer and sparse cross-entropy for loss function. Mechanisms such as attention mechanism and text augmentation were also used for improvement in generated responses by model. Besides, the above generative based chatbot created using two data-sets. The rDany data-set and the Cornell Movie data-set used to train the model with question-answer pairs. For evaluation bleu and perplexity metrics used.
